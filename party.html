				<p>Aniiiiiii....sup dood? Happy birthday! Alright, cool beans...that’s over with! Bye! That’s the end of the note! What? You were expecting more? Nah, I ain’t giving you more unless you give me what I want :))). You are not going to? Ok, that’s fine. You’re lame anyways. Bye bye!! But, for real tho, thanks for being an awesome friend. You have supported me from time to time again and you are a super dependable person when I need to talk to about things. Thanks for being there with me, through all my lows and highs! Couldn’t have anyone better but you to motivate me thru your passions and teach me about pulihora mixing. Luv you, yedava!</p>

				<br>

				<p>Happy Birthday! Its kinda crazy to think that I met you almost four years ago, back when we were just dumb high school students. Its been a fun over the past couple of years getting to know you and making memories and I can’t wait to make more. I hope that you enjoy your gifts and that your birthday is a good one even though we can’t go out. Hopefully when this is all over, we can go out an celebrate…at in-n-out of course.</p>

				<br>

				<p>happy birthday ani!! i'm so happy we met and i'm very grateful for friendship! <3</p>

				<br>

				<p>Ani, you are one of the nicest and most humble people I have ever met.(Not to mention sexiest especially to Sanjeev) Thanks for always being the goofball that makes everyone in the room laugh and the friend that helps anyone in need. Happy Birthday Ani!</p>

				<br>

				<p>Happy Birthday Ani!! We’ve been friends for over a year now and we have made so many memories I can’t pick a favorite. Garba, long drives, my questionable driving, and broken down cars with fireworks were def some of my favorites. Thanks for always being there for me and giving me something to laugh about always. Its always a good time when you are around. Very sad I can’t say you beat teen pregnancy but you’re almost there!! Anyways, happy birthday again I hope you have the best day ever, you deserve it</p>

				<br>

				<p>Anirudhhhhhh, so 19 huh! Well I hope this year will be lit for you. And Hopefully our year at Northside actually goes through and we add more and more memories to the ones we already have. Can’t wait!</p>

				<br>

				<p>From one autist to another", I hope you have a great birthday!</p>

				<br>

				<p>Happy birthday Ani! We’ve come a long way as friends and I can’t wait to grow with you! Here’s to another year of awesome memories and laughs!</p>

				<br>

				<p>Our friendship has come a long way, from going to that weird kid who wanted to be on the CS team to being the only person I am comfortable around. Happy birthday to my always and forever.</p>

				<br>

				<p>Best wishes Ani! We've come a long way since the awkward times during senior year of high school. But in that time since then we've uncovered so many shared interests! The love of coding, relating to indian life and talking about so much more. Enjoy this last year as a teenage and experience everything you've wanted to try out! Oonce again, happy birthday and hope you like you gifts!</p>
